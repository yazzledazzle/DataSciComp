  range: 28 Feb - 09 May, 2019
  deadtime: '2019-05-09 11:59:59'
  timezone: "Australia/Perth"
  pubtime: '2019-02-28'
  note: 'Join a global challenge to test the limits of data science and geology and develop new ideas about mineral exploration.  OZ Minerals, a modern mining company, is opening up >2TB of their own private data from their exploration project, Mount Woods. Can you use this data to predict the next mineral deposit in South Australia? The winning models will be tested in real life, the top predictions will be drilled in 2019.'
  prize: $1,000,000

  note: 'Join a global challenge to test the limits of data science and geology and develop new ideas about mineral exploration. This challenge provides a far greater number of training points for your model, compared to the main Explorer Challenge stream, however the data is sparser. You are welcome to use your findings and work from this challenge for the main Explorer Challenge stream. A leaderboard will be provided for benchmarking and feedback purposes but won’t be used in the final judging. We’re looking for data science teams who can master geological uncertainty, predictive accuracy, and tell an awesome story with data.'
